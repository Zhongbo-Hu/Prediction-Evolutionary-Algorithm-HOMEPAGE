## * 1. Grey Prediction Evolution Algorithm (GPE) -- Articles / our team:

The grey prediction evolution algorithm (GPE) [3] proposed by Zhongbo Hu et.al (2020) is a stochastic optimization algorithm with strong exploration capability. The algorithm considers the population sequence of evolutionary algorithms as a time series, and then uses the grey model (GM(1,1)) to predict offspring individuals. So far, the relevant researches are mainly carried out from the following aspects: (1) Employ different grey prediction models to construct other versions of GPEs, such as grey prediction evolution algorithm based on even difference grey model (GPEed)[1], multivariable grey prediction evolution algorithm (MGPE)[4], and grey prediction evolution algorithm based on accelerated even grey model (GPEae)[7]. (2) Introduce evolutionary strategies to improve GPEs, such as grey prediction evolution algorithm based on topological opposition-based learning (TOGPE) [5] and simplified non-equidistant grey prediction evolution algorithm [9]. (3) Apply GPEs to solve particular application problems, such as multiobjective grey prediction evolution algorithm for environmental/economic dispatch problem (MOGPE) [6],  multimodal multiobjective optimization (MMGPE)[2], automated test case generation for path coverage (GPE-IS) [8] and community group buying [10]. The GPE algorithms are the first kind of prediction-based evolution algorithms.
